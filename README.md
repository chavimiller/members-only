# members-only

This project is a members-only message board built with Express and PostgreSQL, demonstrating back-end skills with user authentication and role-based access control. Users can register and log in through Passport.js, with passwords securely encrypted in the database. The application allows different levels of access: non-members can post anonymously, members can see authors and timestamps, and admins can delete posts. All data is managed in a PostgreSQL database, with structured backend code handling database queries and application logic. The app is organized with separate routes, controllers, and views to manage user requests, render pages, and interact with the database. The entire Express environment is set up from scratch, including routing, middleware, and session management.
